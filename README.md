# Tactical Doom

## Configuration

This project is basically an Obsidian configuration file, which you can [access here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tukkek/tactical-doom/main/CONFIG.txt) (right-click and Save As should work too).

Using Obsidian's `Config Manager`, either press Load to open the saved file or copy the configurations to your clipboard manually and then press Paste. Either way, to finish, click Use to confirm the changes and you can then proceeed to generate your Tactical Doom WAD.

If you don't want to lose your previous settings, Save them to a backup file before you do any of the operations here.
